## Terms
Participants can create a team (group) of members to compete in a workout tournament. A participant can be a leader of a group, or can also have the option of joining an existing team.

If a member is a team leader, then the person has the option to view, edit, delete, or leave a particular group.

You can view the list of members that are currently participating (to see if you are interested in joining the team). All members can view groups that they are part of or are interested in joining.
